### 🚀 About Me  

I am a **builder, researcher, and innovator** who operates at the intersection of **justice-tech, customer success, and AI**. I’ve created and continue to refine **Achieve Reentry**, an ecosystem designed to support returning citizens with tools like job-matching, resume builders, and onboarding flows.  

Alongside this, I’m deeply invested in **AI-driven context engineering and prompt engineering**, designing custom GPTs to support customer success workflows, ticket triage, analytics, and even RPG-style learning experiences. My work reflects a strong balance of technical detail, **data analytics**, user-centric design, and a commitment to equitable reentry opportunities.  

Professionally, I juggle multiple roles: **Customer Success at Nucleos**, a part-time roles as a **Generative AI Specialist at Innodata**, and a wide range of personal and academic pursuits in AI, machine learning, and data analytics. I’m detail-oriented, especially with coding (**Python, Node.js, MongoDB, Git/GitHub**), infrastructure (**VS Code, Google Cloud, Docker**), and data visualization (**ApexCharts, pandas, scikit-learn**). I also draw from my background in **Industrial-Organizational Psychology**, applying data-driven methods to people analytics and leadership research. Career-wise, I’m building toward roles in **AI/ML, people analytics, and advanced product development**—leveraging my experience, technical learning, and passion for building tools that make complex systems accessible and impactful.
