### 🚀 About Me  

I’m an AI-first builder who turns messy, real-world workflows into structured, automatable systems. Most of my work sits at the intersection of AI, secure/limited environments, and education/justice-tech — where you can’t just “use the cloud,” so you have to design for context, constraints, and people.

I work backwards from the process: capture context → package it for an LLM → return repeatable artifacts (docs, emails, tickets, admin steps). I’m actively targeting roles like AI Solutions Architect and Forward-Deployed AI Engineer where this kind of applied, multi-tool AI work is the job.

**What I actually do (process over projects)**

### 🧠 How I Work
- **Context engineering:** build prompts/system cards so AI can operate on support, admin, and dev tasks without re-explaining everything.
- **Multi-environment delivery:** WSL/Ubuntu, GitHub Actions, Packer, offline/Kolibri, and MCP/HTTP-style tool calling.
- **AI for dev, not just users:** use LLMs to generate docs, triage issues, and scaffold integrations (PostHog MCP, admin platforms, LMS flows).
- **Documentation as a feature:** every flow gets turned into something a future teammate (or AI agent) can run.

### 🛠️ Skills & Stack
- **AI & Automation:** Custom GPTs, prompt/system design, LLM-assisted debugging, workflow generators
- **Backend / Scripting:** Python, Node.js/JavaScript
- **Web / Templating:** HTML/CSS, EJS
- **Data / Storage:** MongoDB, SQLite, pandas
- **Dev environment:** Git/GitHub, VS Code on WSL/Ubuntu, Docker, Google Cloud, Raspberry Pi image builds (Packer/GitHub Actions)
- **Domains:** justice-tech, education platforms, secure/offline delivery
