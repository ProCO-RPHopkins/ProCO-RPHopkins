### 🚀 About Me
I’m an AI-first builder who turns messy, real-world workflows into structured, automatable systems. Most of my work sits at the intersection of AI, secure/limited environments, and education/justice-tech — places where you can’t just “use the cloud,” so you have to design for context, constraints, and people.

I work backwards from the process: capture context → package it for an LLM → capture context → package it for an LLM → return repeatable systems (workflows, docs, service stubs, and deployment-ready images). I’m actively targeting roles like **AI Solutions Architect** and **Forward-Deployed AI Engineer** where this kind of applied, multi-tool AI work is the job.

### 🧠 How I Work – Process over Projects
- **Context engineering:** build prompts/system cards so AI can operate on support, admin, and dev tasks without re-explaining everything.
- **Dev Environment / Infra:** Git/GitHub (versioned workflows) WSL/Ubuntu, GitHub Actions, Raspberry Pi image builds (Packer), and MCP/HTTP-style tool calling.
- **AI for dev teams:** use LLMs to generate docs, triage issues, and scaffold integrations (PostHog MCP, admin platforms, LMS flows).
- **Documentation as a feature:** every flow becomes something a future teammate — or AI agent — can run.

### 🛠️ Skills & Stack
- **AI & Automation:** Custom GPTs, prompt/system design, LLM-assisted debugging, workflow generators
- **Backend / Scripting:** Python, Node.js/JavaScript
- **Web / Templating:** HTML/CSS, EJS
- **Data / Storage:** MongoDB, SQLite, pandas
- **Dev Environment / Infra:** Git/GitHub, VS Code on WSL/Ubuntu, Docker, Google Cloud, Raspberry Pi image builds (Packer/GitHub Actions)
- **Domains:** justice-tech, education platforms, secure/offline delivery
